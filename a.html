    <h2>Leslie Chow</h2>
    <img src="chow.jpg" alt="Leslie Chow">
    <p class="content">Chow's personality is affected by two things; his insane life as a drug lord, mobster and international criminal, and his frequent and heavy abuse of multiple different drugs and copious amounts of alcohol.</p>

    <p class="content">Mr. Chow is very upbeat and outgoing. He likes to make new friends and is quite trustworthy. He goes out of his way to help his friends and is loyal and loving to those he considers close to him, although he can come across as belittling and offensive but it is all light hearted banter on his part. Chow's number one goal is to keep the party going, even if that involves illegal actions to fund it.</p>

    <p class="content">Even though Chow may come across as a crazy, erratic buzz junkie, there is more beneath the surface; Chow's mind is thinking up new tricks, he has street smarts and experience in "underworld" activities as well as links in all kinds of places. When you look past the loud, erratic, drug-fueled visage you realize that Leslie Chow is a highly intelligent, cunning, tenacious and merciless individual with very little remorse for those who cross him or who he screws over, the carnage and madness that transpires over the three films are amusing and "funny" to him but as Leslie says in his own words' "Nobody wants to see that, well, except me, but I was born bad."</p>

    <p class="content">The only things more important to Leslie Chow than the party, is loyalty and friendship, purely because he loves to share the party experience and making mad memories.</p>

    <p class="content">Chow is an international criminal, which is visualized in all films.</p>

    <p class="content">He is usually seen naked, accompanied by his pubic hair and extremely small penis - a running gag throughout the film series. Chow himself has also hinted that his testicles are small too.</p>

    <p class="content">Chow has attacked Phil, Stu, and Alan in all three films, minus Doug, having never actually met Doug until the end of Part III.</p>

    <p class="content">He became best friends with Alan premature to the second film and even stayed in contact with him when Chow was imprisoned in Thailand.</p>

    <p class="content">Chow loves to have a good time, and has frequently partied with the Wolfpack. Chow is considered a "cancer" by Phil since the Wolfpack always get involved with his criminal activities whenever they get in contact with Chow.</p>

    <p class="content">Chow was last seen appearing from a room in a Las Vegas suite, declaring that the Wolfpack had another "sick night" after Alan's wedding to Cassandra.</p>

    <p class="content">He wears women's shoes, as confirmed in the first film, being a women's size 6.</p>
